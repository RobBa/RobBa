## Hey 👋

I am Robert. I am an almost self-taught software engineer. From 2020 to end of 2024 I have been conducting research as part of a PhD at the [cyber-analytics lab](https://cyber-analytics.nl) at the TU Delft. Here I have been conducting research on state machine learning algorithms, mostly to learn from data streams and to infer surrogate models from neural networks. More on my research can be found [on my homepage](https://robba.github.io). During this time I have also been working extensively on the [Flexfringe tool](https://github.com/tudelft-cda-lab/FlexFringe), where I have mostly implemented the active learning library.

Apart from that I code mostly in C++, C# and Python, with most applications so far in either the application domain or the ML domain. But I am always curious and like to expand my knowledge. Lately I am reading up on embedded systems, and I am practicing on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller from ST Microelectronics. A description of the controller can be found [here](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html). I will post more projects that I have been working on here at a later point in time.
